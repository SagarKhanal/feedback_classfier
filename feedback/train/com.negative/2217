Not everything is perfect 

They just don't distinguish more needy patients

One of the unmanaged government hospitals

I havenot a good experinces with this hospital


One of the most unsuitable hospital you'll ever find in the world 


Staffs are not just friendly

OPD is not at all systematic

Very bad public hospital

Notaffordable and expensive medical services

NotWell facilitated hospital 

It has poor working environment,  not so good staff and low service 
 
Limited beds donot love being a part of it always
