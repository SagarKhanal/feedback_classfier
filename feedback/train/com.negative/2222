 Long wait on Saturday morning. Made an appointment and took 2 hours to get seen. Medical assistant did not seem engaged at all and front desk lady was trying to multitask but was not very efficient. I was in bed of urgent care but did not see any sense of urgency.


They were not able to help me one bit. So appointment and wait was worthless


She was really rude

lab arenot well equipped

one of the bad hospital in  with low class technology & equipment used regarding the patient care with rude staff behaviour.

I havenot been impressed with hospital mediciti

very much unsatisfied with the service  n doctors consult

professionalism is the thing lacking in most of the staff members.


Absolutely money oriented than service oriented.


2. Staffs lack professionalism. Need induction training before putting them in service. 


3. Poor responses by Dr. in follow-up when tests are done outside. IS IT COMPULSORY TO DO TESTs IN MEDICITY? Is it bad to do test outside with Jestha Nagarik Consession.?


4. Today I had a very unpleasant response by Dr. and out of 4 medicine he gave 2 types hard pain killer and other two calcium, and antacid tab. Is the pain killer only the solution?


5. Hospital is like hotel. But service is poor n sad.


6. Ridiculous responses........
