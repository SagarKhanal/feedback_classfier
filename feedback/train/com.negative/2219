If you want 5 star hotel facilities go there but if you want treatment of your disease never go there. And also if you decide to go make sure to load your pocket. No matter what disease you have be prepared to spend 17 to 20 lakhs with no guarantee of being cured.


This hospital doesn't even deserve 0 stars. They are looters not a hospital. My husband was taken there, they looted our money and no treatment was done. Rather he acquired hospital Pneumonia and they even couldn't treat that. They input him 11 different types of antibiotic without confirming the disease. They even administered him TB meds for no reason which made him further weak.
This hospital just cares about money not about patients. 

I recommend noone to go there.

"poor care from all.

 multi speciality hospital in Nepal providing low class service and clean environment. This hospital is not rich in international level physical infrastructures 


I would give 0 stars if I could. They are there to loot people's money. We brought our dad to do one test. And they admitted him to ICU without any reason. He was admitted to BNB and was okay in normal ward. They kept him in ICU for 17 days just to take our money. For no reason we spent our 17 lakhs there and when he was discharged on our request his condition was worst than what he was taken there to do the procedure.

 
If anyone wants to spend money go there otherwise if you want treatment never go there.


Rude staff at new registration counter. Almost all of the staff don't know how to give proper hospitality.


A lot of counter and places for queue, that creates confusion. We have to give same personal details at each counter/desk.
Appointment time not followed, we have to wait around 45 mins for doctor.
Place is clean though.


Best doctors arenot available
