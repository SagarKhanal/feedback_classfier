Not good service. Once went there for dad's minor operation,

lack of instantaneous services


I donot found proper facility services


Treatment received at Civil service hospital by expert surgeon is bad

Literally have to wait 3 hours just for registration and when the doctor comes he only checks 20 30 people a day in each department.. i had to waste 3 days just to check up

Unmanaged hospital


doesnot have appointment facility.

Don't expect much from them.

Only preference is given to civil permanent job holders..


More things need to change
