One of the worst dental hospital. Agreed with Raby Lama. This is not hospital just time pass for both dentist and patient

They don't care abt the patient,

Worst hospitality and no respect for patient. 

They treat u only until your money is due

NOT WORTHY FOR DENTAL PATIENT.WORSE THEN ONE CAN IMAGINE

bad service 

dissatisfied

quality isnot good

nureses are mean

surrounding environmeng is so dirty

its better not to go there
