The doctor is great i am sorry to say i cannot see him due to the series of failures by his staff and web site at Savant Care.

Dr. Walker was great. Timely, helpful, interested. Strongly recommend.

No wait time, Beautiful building, lovely man that is easy to talk to. who could ask for more?

Great physician! I am an MIT student working in San Fran for the summer so I cant see my regular physician in Boston. I was very impressed with Dr. Walker's knowledge and interest in my health even though I might only be a patient for the summer. Highly recommend.

It was a good initial consultation. I felt comfortable talking to Dr Walker about my past and some of the goals I look to work on. I look forward to our next appointment.

Amazing! Dr. Walker is warm and highly skilled. Highly recommend.

Had a great experience and the doctor addressed each and every one of my concerns. The interaction was casual yet serious. He explained his thoughts after hearing mine and I couldn't have asked for a better medical professional. Highly recommend.

Dr. Walker was extremely professional, respectful, and helpful. I was a bit nervous in going to see him but he made me feel very comfortable and overall it was a great experience.
