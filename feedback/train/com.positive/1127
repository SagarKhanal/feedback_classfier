 
Lovely Dr. always accommodating, always on time. Easy to visit with no stress attached !

He was very attentive and knowledgeable. I feel like he truly cared and listened and I felt like I was in good hands.


Dr. Walker is incredible professional and understanding. I felt very comfortable communicating my problems to him without feeling any judgement. He's a wonderful doctor, and is the first doctor (of 5) that has actually taken the time to find the underlying issues and treat those with minimal medication.

He was kind and open while providing valuable insight in a straight-forward way.


I felt very comfortable speaking with Dr. Walker. He was very caring, thoughtful, and a great listener. I would strongly recommend!

This man is an absolute saint and I feel so lucky to have found him on ZocDoc. I had my first session with him today, absolute professional, extremely thoughtful questions, and authentic empathy for everything I was feeling. I highly recommend Dr. Walker to all folks - please do not let the negative reviews regarding the administrative system deter you from scheduling an appointment with him. The admins were very lovely to speak with on the phone and helped with the paperwork afterwards. No biggy.


It was great. Exactly what I was looking for.

Dr Walker was very kind, professional, and helpful!

no-nonsense, very authoritative (in a great, respectful way), knows what he's talking about and does so with rapport that makes you feel comfortable. can't recommend highly enough.

Made me feel comfortable and in control of any decisions regarding treatment. I will certainly be seeing him again.


Genuine, kind and professional. I look forward to my visits with Dr. Walker!

I'm feeling so much better, I'm so glad I found Dr Walker.
