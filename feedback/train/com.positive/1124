Warm & kind

Excellent care!

Its my fst visit. All looks good. May be I can talk after my improvements. 

Dr Kanchan was very good. She asked alot of questions and gave me alot of helpful answers.

First visit very good. The jury is still out until a couple more appts.

Great facilities and administrative processes. Dr. Sorensen is very thoughtful and patient to listening my concerns. I feel absolutely comfortable to communicate with him.

Really patient and good listener. Seems like he really cares. Respectful

Convenient check-in process, no wait time. Dr. Sorensen was very informative and helped me come up with a few treatments for my anxiety. He was very easy to talk to and very knowledgeable. Highly recommend.

Very professional, courteous, to the point, and yet a great listener - I know I'm going to enjoy seeing him more regularly after this 1st visit!


Very knowledgeable. Professional. Took time with me the first appointment to review history and meds. Very happy. Will continue to see as my new MD

He was very intuitive and asked great questions to get a deeper understanding of what could possibly be wrong. He gave many alternatives for medication and non medication methods to improve my mental health.

I felt comfortable. He listen to me and asked great questions. I like how he explained things to me in details.
