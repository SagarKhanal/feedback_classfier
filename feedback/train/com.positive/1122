"I always feel like I get plenty of time to explain my issues without feeling rushed. I've managed to get in to be seen within a timely manner even without an appointment. The staff is great and the CRNP and MD have fabulous bedside manners. I'm a RN myself and very impressed with this facility."
"Dr. MacFarlane is awesome. He is caring and his utmost concern is your comfort."
"Very comfortable coming to this office on a semi-regular basis...Everyone is pleasant and takes the time to listen to concerns, etc..."
Dr Lawrence and the entire team at Viroqua are excellent. All team members were competent , efficient, and very kind. My husband and I were well informed and felt welcome. 
My experience was painless and I would highly recommend him to anyone who is experiencing pain.
Dr. Jordan Slutsky and his team are excellent. The care that was given to my husband made us feel comfortable, confident, and secure. What an example for health professionals!

Dr Katie rand. Dentist in lake worth Florida. It was a mistake for me to go to her office. I would recommend that u do not make the same mistake
Awesome to find a website that tells the truth about Drs one way or the other. You absolutely can NOT get more accuracy than from patient reviews. Point blank.
I researched a doctor, and it listed 25 reviews on him, all either 4 or 5 star reviews. When I clicked on the reviews it would not let me see them. I tried this on phone and computer.
Healthgrades has fake reviews of doctors. They are aware of this and do not do anything about it. They simply make money off of these fake reviews and are not a service anyone should take seriously due to this.ss
