My friend recently had a baby. She was admitted to CK Birla Hospital for the delivery. Once the baby was delivered, we found out that the baby was underweight and had some complications. But CK Birla Hospital was prepared for a situation like this. They have a neonatal care wing, with all the infrastructure and experts you could possibly think of. Thanks to the doctors& staff at CK Birla, the baby is healthy now.

Hospitals are a common entity nowadays, but it is the little things that sets one apart from the crowd. When it comes to services and facilities, I think CK Birla Hospital for Women has set a really high standard. Besides their excellent services, it is their facilities that make people trust them so much. I would recommend CK Birla Hospital to everyone who is looking for great services and world class facilities in Gurgaon.

I visited care eye hospital for the first time on 30.4.19. I found staff technicians and doctors very cooperative. I thank shri dharmendra sharma, desk officer who managed my entry and helped me at every stage for my test procedure and consultation with doctors

I like it very much and so well warming service and treatment

pleasure to meet Dr Friedrick

Fully satisfied
