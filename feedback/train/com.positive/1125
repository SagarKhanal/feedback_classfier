 
Doc was great and took time to get to know me. Appreciated how he was able to get me to open up.

I have not got to know dr Sorensen that well yet but he seems like a great guy from my first visit with him.


It was my first time even in therapy and I felt very comfortable


My session was warm and nicely paced. I got asked all the right questions. The whole office worked nicely around my anxiety and created momentum for me to reduce it.

Dr.Dusay is a wonderful and caring doctor. Attentive, caring, and incredibly knowledgable in the field of psychiatry.

He’s the best, period. As. Patient, you deserve a caring, smart, very knowledgeable Doctor. And that is Dr. John Dusay. Don’t settle for a sub par Dr out there, go to Dr. Dusay, he’s first class all the way. True Blue. ??


Brilliant Doctor and amazing man. He’s the best, period.


Best Dr. in the Bay Area !!!!

Amazing doctor, very knowledgeable. Really listened to my struggles and despite me resisting drugs, he was assertive and convinced me to at least try. Now I am feeling much better.

I've just finished my first appointment with Dr. Dusay and I'm blown away by how thorough, analytical, and personable he is. He's a great listener and has this big aura of respect towards people. Highly recommend!

I've been seeing Dr. Dusay for a couple years now. He has an incredible amount of experience, and has always been extremely attentive to my needs. I'd highly reccommend him.

Dr.Dusay is a great physician. He listens and offers carefully thought out plans . He always makes me feel like I am his top priority, taking my opinions into consideration.


Great doctor with much knowledge, felt very comfortable discussing my medical issues with him.
